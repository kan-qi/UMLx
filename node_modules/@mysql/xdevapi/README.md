# MySQL Connector/Node.js with X DevAPI

The Node.js Connector is an asynchronous promise-based client library for the
X DevAPI (using the X Protocol) that was introduced in MySQL 5.7.12.

MySQL 5.7 is an open-source relational database that is secure, high
performing, and easy to use. The X DevAPI supports relational tables and JSON 
documents making it possible to use both tables and collections at the same
time.

For general information about the X DevAPI, please refer to documentation on
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/.

## Requirements

This library requires at least Node.js 4.2.x and MySQL 5.7.12.

## Installation

This library is organized in a way that it can be installed using Node.js's npm
tool into your project:
  `npm install mysql-connector-nodejs-1.0.6.tar.gz`
or directly from npmjs.com:
  `npm install @mysql/xdevapi`
Please refer to http://npmjs.com for more information on npm.

## Getting Started

Here's a small example of how to leverage the library using MySQL as a document-store.

```js
const mysql = require('@mysql/xdevapi');

mysql
    .getSession({
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 33060,
        dbUser: 'user',
        dbPassword: 'passwd'
    })
    .then(session => {
        console.log('Session created');
        
        return session.createSchema('test_schema');
    })
    .then(schema => {
        console.log('Schema created');
        
        return schema.createCollection('myCollection');
    })
    .then(collection => {
        console.log('Collection created')
        
        return Promise.all([
            collection
                .add({ baz: { foo: 'bar' } }, { foo: { bar: 'baz' } })
                .execute(),
            collection
                .find("$.baz.foo == 'bar'")
                .execute(row => {
                    console.log('Found row: %j', row);
                })
                .then(res => {
                    console.log('Collection find finished');
                }),
            collection
                .remove("($.foo.bar) == 'baz'")
                .execute()
                .then(() => {
                    console.log('Document deleted');
                }),
            collection
                .drop()
                .then(() => {
                    console.log('Collection deleted');
                })
        ]);
    })
    .then(() => {
        return session.dropSchema('test_schema');
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log('Schema deleted');

        return session.close();
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log('Session destroyed');
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.log(err.stack);
    });
```
