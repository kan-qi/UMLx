%
%    Boetticher, G., Lokhandwala, N., James C. Helm, Understanding the Human
%    Estimator, Second International Predictive Models in Software Engineering
%    (PROMISE) Workshop co-located at the 22nd IEEE International Conference on
%    Software Maintenance, Philadelphia, PA, September, 2006. More information is
%    available at http://nas.cl.uh.edu/boetticher/research.html
%
% Since PROMISE 2006, the data set expanded by about 50 percent. The additional
% tuples allowed us to divide the data into 3 major categories. Those who severely
% underestimate (first 25 tuples). Those who accurately estimate (next 25 tuples).
% And those who severely overestimate (last 25 tuples). The PROMISE 2007 experiments
% compare the underestimators with the accurate estimators and the overestimators with
% the accurate estimators.

% 5. Number of Instances: 75 
%
% 6. Number of Attributes: 14 independent variables and 1 dependent variable 
%
% 7. Attribute Information:
%
% Numeric Degree:  This attribute refers to the level of education of the participant.
%                  2=High School, 3=Bachelors, 4=Masters,5=Ph.D.
%
% TechUGCourses: This refers to the number of technical undergraduate courses that
%                the participant has taken.
%
% TechGCourses: This refers to the number of technical graduate courses that
%               the participant has taken.
%
% MgmtUGCourses: This refers to the number of management undergraduate courses that
%                the participant has taken.
%
% MgmtGCourses: This refers to the number of management graduate courses that
%               the participant has taken.
%
% Total Workshops: This refers to the total number of workshops that
%                  the participant has attended.
%
% Total Conferences: This refers to the total number of conferences that
%                    the participant has attended.
%
% TotalLangExp: This refers to the total number of languages and experience in those
%               languages that the participant has.
%
% Hardware Proj Mgmt Exp: This corresponds to the total amount of time that the 
%                         respondant has been estimating hardware projects.
%
% Software Proj Mgmt Exp: This corresponds to the total amount of time that the 
%                         respondant has been estimating software projects.
%
% No Of Hardware Proj Estimated: This refers to the total number of hardware projects
%                                that the participant has estimated.
%                               
% No Of Software Proj Estimated: This refers to the total number of software projects
%                                that the participant has estimated.
%
% Domain Exp: The domain experience refers to how much experience the participant has
%             in the oil and gas industry.
%
% Procurement Industry Exp: The procurement industry experience refers to the amount
%                           of time, in years, that the participant has regarding
%                           procurement.
%
% ABS((TotalEstimates-TotalActual)/TotalActual): This is the class variable. It 
%                           represents the overall relative error for the participant's
%                           estimates.
