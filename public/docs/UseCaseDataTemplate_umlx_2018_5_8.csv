,,*A set of user-system interactions to realize certain business value. They are natural classification of system functionality.,"The scenarios in the interactions between actors and systems, for example, the rainy and sunny day scenarios, different modes of operations, etc.",A detailed list of transactions.,The number of system operations required to realize the transaction.,"The number of data element types involved in the system operations to realize the transactions. For example, the login successfully transaction may require user name, password, login success message, etc.","The number of interface components involved within the transaction. For example, the login successfully transaction, user name, password, success message display widget may be required.","The number of components invovled in implementing the transactions, for example, to implement ""login susccessfully"" transaction, it may require three compoentns, information validator, user information quiry component, feedback display, etc.","For components involved in the transaction, they can be of different levels of difficulty, for example, of different number of interfaces to understand, the different number of source code to read, etc.",The overall rating of the difficulty for implementing the transaction. The number can be given based on the experience of the project manager.
