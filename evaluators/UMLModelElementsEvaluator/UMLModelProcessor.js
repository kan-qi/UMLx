/*
 * Script Name: count numbers of the independent paths for each type of operational scenarios 
 * Author: kqi
 * Purpose: to search through the diagram to find out all the independent paths, 
 * and to find out the corresponding operational scenarios they corresponds.
 * There are five different identified basic operational scenarios:
 * 1. actor -> boundary -> control -> entity, mainly for data management
 * 2. actor -> boundary -> control -> entity -> control -> boundary, mainly for data management with feedback
 * 3. actor -> boundary -> control -> boundary, mainly for validation or interface management
 * 4. actor1 -> boundary -> control -> actor2, mainly for calling for service outside of the system
 * 5. actor2 -> control -> entity, mainly for outside system calling all services from the system
 * 
 * I'll have to rework on the pattern tree. To integrate widecard functionality.
 * 
 * summary: search for independent paths, and recognize the patterns.
 * Date: 8/9/2017
 * 
 * There is no functional operations any more, the hierarchy of operational characteristics are listed below:
 * 
 * transaction (TN): {
 *  control (CTRL): {
 *  	data management (DM) : {
 *  		external input (EI),
 *  		external inquiry (EQ)
 *  	}
 *      interface management (INT),
 *      external invocation (EXTIVK),
 *      external call (EXTCLL)
 *  }
 * }
